This is a module of Matlab codes to compress images using K-means clustering  , If the input image contains n different colors, the output image can be represented using only k << n colors, achieving high level of compression, by grouping regions with similar colors in a single cluster.

We can change the value of K(no of colours) according to our need 

For example:-
